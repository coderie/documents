## Code of Conduct

The Coderie Software Development Meetup (Coderie) is a social and professional group based out of Erie, PA. We gather together to discuss topics related to code, programming, and the tech world at large. While off­topic discussion is permitted, conversation should be governed by the standards of professionalism and courtesy. Guests come from a variety of backgrounds and viewpoints, and as such, topics covered should leave political, social, religious, racial, sexual and other sensitive issues off the table. We strive to provide a safe environment for all guests, and sensitive topics are not conducive to a safe and comfortable environment.

## Harassment Policy

We do not tolerate harassment of our members and guests in any form. Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

## If A Problem Arises

Violations of the code of conduct or harassment policy will be dealt with on a case­by­case basis by the organizers of the group and those involved. Those violating these rules may be sanctioned or asked to leave the group at the discretion of the organizers, typically following a written warning. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a group organizer immediately. Group organizers can be identified and contacted through our Meetup website at: [http://meetup.com/coderie](http://meetup.com/coderie).
